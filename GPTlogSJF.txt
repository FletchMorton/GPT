Can you make a similar code for a Pre-emptive SJF (Shortest Job First) process scheduling algorithm instead of a FIFO process scheduling algorithm?

Can you make selection based off of remaining_time?

Can you change selection to where if an arriving process and current_process have equal remaining_time, then current_process remains the selected process, and the new process is required to wait until current_process is finished?

Can you change the code so that when process 1 is preempted by process 2, process 2 has start_time = current_time

Why does process 2 not finish at time 11?

Can you undo that change? I was looking at a different input, and your code was actually correct as presented

Can you change the processes array to be "processes = [
        Process(1, 0, 5),
        Process(2, 1, 4),
        Process(3, 4, 2),
    ]"

Why does process 2 not finish at Time 11? Selected at Time 7, with a burst of 4, decrementing current_process.remaining_time each time unit should see process 2 completed at Time 11

> This did not work. I found that an else statement was being triggered where it should not have been yet

Can you only have the simulation start printing "Idle" once every process has been completed?

Can you only have the simulation start printing "Idle" once every process has remaining_time = 0?

Why does process 2's remaining_time stop getting decrementing after Time 7? This should not happen, and is preventing process 2 from finishing processing

undo that change

Can you replace the code entirely with

> The revertion generation was flawed, so I opted to just go back to an earlier copy of the code. There is probably an easier, less messy way of accomplishing this, but I haven't thought of that yet

Can you remove the "Idle" output from the code

Can you change line 31 to be "if process_queue or current_process is not None"

> Somehow assumed the wrong line

That was not the correct line of code, please undo that change

Change "if process_queue:" to "if process_queue or current_process is not None:"

Undo that change

> As you can see, I should have realized at this point that it would have just been more efficient to manually fix the code, but I continued to probe chatGPT

Instead of selecting the current process by using "current_process = process_queue.pop(0)", instead change the code to set current_process = process_queue[0] when a process is selected, and then call process_queue.pop(0) once current_process is completed

> This finally fixed the issue I was wrestling with, but affected the Idle printing

Can you change the body of the else statement corresponding to the "if process_queue:" statement to "print(f"Time {current_time}: Idle")
            current_time += 1"

This looks good. Good job, ChatGPT.
