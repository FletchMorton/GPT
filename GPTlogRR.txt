Can you make a similar code for a Round Robin process scheduling algorithm instead of a Pre-emptive SJF (Shortest Job First) process scheduling algorithm?

Can change the code to make sure that if a process ends, the next process is selected and beings executing in the next time unit, and not the unit in which the first process completed?
